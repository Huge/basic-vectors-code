# Instructions to get embeddign vectors:

Install Required Libraries:

bash
`pip install sentence-transformers numpy`

Prepare Your Text File:

Ensure you have a text file with the path you provide when running the script.

Run the Script:

Run the script from the command line, providing the path to your text file:

bash
`python script_name.py path_to_your_text_file.txt`

Explanation:

Reading the Text:

The read_text function reads the entire content of the file into a string.

Chunking the Text:

The chunk_text function splits the text into chunks of a specified size with optional overlap.

Generating Embeddings:

The generate_embeddings function uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to generate embeddings for each chunk.

Finding Most Similar Chunks:

The find_most_similar function computes the cosine similarity between all pairs of embeddings and identifies the top 2 most similar chunks for each chunk.

Printing Embeddings and Similar Chunks:

The embeddings are printed directly, and the indices of the most similar chunks are printed for each chunk.

Notes:

Adjust Parameters:

You can adjust chunk_size, overlap, model_name, and top_k in the main function as needed.

Model Selection:

The model 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' is used by default for generating embeddings. You can choose other models from Hugging Face's model hub.

Handling Large Files:

For very large files, consider processing the text in larger chunks or using more efficient methods to manage memory usage.
